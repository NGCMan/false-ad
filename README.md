# False Antimatter Dimensions - An evil AD clone

Has the 9th dimension. And the 10th. And the 11th. And...

NOTE: This clone is no longer being developed and breaks on eternity (but not before). Many of the achievements are unreachable, and the bottom right Infinity Upgrade is useless. However, the really different part (all the dimensions, all the challenges) is reachable.

I was obsessed with the original Antimatter Dimensions for a few weeks, and I decided that was unhealthy. So I made my own version by starting with the original and making the changes I wanted and now I'm obsessed with that (both changing the code and just playing it). I'm not sure if this is any healthier. (It's not.)

notes.txt has saves at the end. The ones at the bottom should work, but the ones nearer the top probably only work with old versions (before all the revisions I've made).

Currently challenges, most achievements, and most infinity upgrades don't work. Also, anything remotely related to Eternity of course doesn't work.

Please do create an issue if there is anything weird or wrong.

Most notable changes:
- Dimensions 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16
- New infinity upgrades
- No galaxies or replicantis
