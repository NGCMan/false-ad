"What the hell, Hevipelle?", "Maybe if I initialize the achievements in both these places it will magically work. You'll know it worked if they start grey and turn green when you get them, rather than the reverse.",

"My strategy for removing features I don't want: just remove them and hope I won't decide that I should add them again.",
